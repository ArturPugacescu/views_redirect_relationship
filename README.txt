==========

A module built to help admins keep track of their redirects by establishing a views relationship between redirect entities and nodes


Overview

Views Redirect Relationship was created with a specific purpose in mind: documenting where all the internal redirects generated by Redirect module are going. While the Redirect module itself provides a simple list (found at yoursite/admin/config/search/redirect), this was not deemed enough for a large organization with thousands of internal redirects.

The module provides a relationship connector within the Views interface between Redirects and Nodes, accomplished by creating an nid field within the Redirect table that reads from the redirect destination and converts any node/### found there to the raw NID.

This relationship allows for Views to include fields from the redirect itself and its connected node, as can be seen in the included default views.


Versions

Views Redirect Relationship was built for Drupal 7.x, and only works with it at the moment. Given Views inclusion into core in Drupal 8.x, the module will be reworked for that release if necessary.


Dependencies

Given that the module uses views to display lists of redirects, it requires the Views and Redirect modules.
